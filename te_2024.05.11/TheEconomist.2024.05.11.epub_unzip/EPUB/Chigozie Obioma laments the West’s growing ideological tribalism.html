In keeping with Albert Einstein’s dictum that “the important thing is not to stop questioning; curiosity has its own reason for existing,” I exposed myself to every possible idea. </p><p>I have studied religious texts from the Bible to the Koran to the Book of Mormon to the tenets of Odinani, the pantheistic religion of Nigeria’s Igbo people. I have read political philosophies from Winston Churchill’s “The River War” to Karl Marx’s “Communist Manifesto”. I have read books considered to be standard-bearers of leftist thinking and those seen as right-wing intellectual staples.</p><p>Sometimes I find myself holding several conflicting, incommensurable beliefs, but most often I arrive at a centre—a rich ground that enables me to fully appreciate the complexity of the human condition, to understand the substance of different ideas and why others might hold them. I am forever open to the possibility of changing my mind. </p><p>That is why I got such a shock in my first few weeks in America. At an event at the University of Michigan an African-American speaker was hectored and shouted down by a mob. I could not understand; why wouldn’t the audience hear him out? The response I received—that the speaker’s view was “problematic”—would reverberate through the next few months and years. Speakers across various platforms in America were drowned out, attacked and silenced. On the internet, this “cancel culture” took hold. </p><p>Often, those doing the silencing were not even aware that their views were so inconsistent with the values they claimed to hold. Commentators who railed against free-speech infringements on social media then called for banning literature they dismissed as “diversity, equity and inclusion books” or “un-American.” The same Twitter staff who had censored a sitting American president called on the Nigerian government to end its Twitter ban, citing human-rights grounds.</p><p>These conflicting actions and reactions, I think, are a result of a societal malaise that has been developing in the past decade or so: radical incuriosity. It is, in essence, the fear of ideas. </p><p>Pre-modern cultures often held superstitious beliefs about others. There were communities divided only by a river who believed wrongly that there were cannibals on the other shore. Europeans initially believed Sebastian Münster’s 16th-century map of Africa that suggested cyclopes were the dominant occupants of west Africa. Mass literacy clearly helped dispel these ideas over time, but a similarly prejudiced belief system seems to have returned, especially to the West. It is a division of the world into otherness. Whose side am I on, a reader might ask at this stage: a leftist activist’s, an anti-woke reactionary’s? If I provoke with an idea, must I necessarily fall into such a binary category—no more justly than to be judged a cannibal or a cyclops?</p><p>This tendency reflects a tribal instinct. It is true that to adapt within a community, humans often develop tribal affinities. They embrace certain ideas accepted by the tribe and find ways to insulate them. When ideas are protected from scrutiny they become sacred, and an unconscious fear develops of these community truths being challenged. A tribe forgets that human constructs are fallible, and that the best way to strengthen an idea is by exposing it to other ideas. This sacralisation is the main reason modern societies are splintering into dangerous and destructive polarisation. </p><p>And it is not just cultural tensions in liberal democracies: we know that dictatorships, cults and repressive systems of all stripes punish dissent in order to maintain ideological or political hegemony. They are by constitution deeply afraid of ideas.</p><p>The best way to float above the allure of ideological tribalism is to adopt what I would call provisional thinking. It is a capacious open-mindedness, encompassing both the moral and the political, in which one’s assumptions can constantly shift, unattached to ideology or dogma. This is, to be sure, a difficult position to hold. Indeed, much of what I have read has made me uncomfortable, or has felt insulting to Africans. Yet exposing myself to foreign or awkward or reprehensible ideas does not mean I must fall under their sway. Reading Marx did not make me a communist, nor did the Book of Mormon make me a Mormon. </p><p>I understand, too, that people have a need for certainty, to build convictions. Being unsure of anything at all is surely a trickier ideological position even than provisional thinking. But it is also possible to get by without answers—to be unafraid, that is, of uncertainty. Here we find reasons for optimism, in the increasing number of people who claim to be agnostic, simply unsure about the existence of God. Living well while being burdened by this fundamental question, open to new thoughts and views on it, is a mark of the kind of intellectual humility I am arguing for. </p><p>The effects on individuals, true empathy for people with differing views, of course would add up to societal effects—an ability for nuanced collective thinking about complex problems and for course-correcting when things don’t work. It might be the only way to save modern society from the widening fractures being caused by a creeping fear of ideas.<span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Chigozie Obioma is the author of “The Fishermen” (2015) and “An Orchestra of Minorities” (2019), both of which were shortlisted for the Booker Prize.
