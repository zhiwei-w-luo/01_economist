  <body><p><span class="te_section_title">The world this week</span></p><p/><h1 class="te_article_title">Politics</h1><h3 class="te_article_datePublished">May 9th 2024</h3><br/><div class="head_image_div"><img src="static_images/af629681e4e051437b90e2b15817cb7b.jpg" alt="" class="te_head_image"/></div><p>For the first time in five years, <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/05/06/visiting-europe-xi-jinping-brings-up-an-old-grievance"><b>Xi Jinping</b> visited Europe</a>. China’s leader was welcomed by his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, who pressed him to help end the war in Ukraine and to establish a more balanced trade relationship. Mr Xi gave little ground. He then moved on to Serbia, where he commemorated the 25th anniversary of America’s bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. “This we should never forget,” he wrote in a piece for a Serbian newspaper. Mr Xi wrapped up his tour in Hungary, a member of the <small>EU</small> and <small>NATO</small> that is also a staunch supporter of China. Mr Xi praised its “independent” foreign policy.</p><p><b>Israel</b> carried out <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/05/09/after-a-dramatic-week-in-gaza-where-does-the-war-stand">air strikes on Rafah</a> in southern <b>Gaza</b> and told 100,000 civilians to leave because it was planning to “operate” there. It took control of part of the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land next to Egypt, as well as the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt. Joe Biden said he would not supply Israel with the weapons that would be used in an attack on Rafah. Meanwhile, Israel temporarily closed Kerem Shalom, a commercial crossing into Gaza through which most humanitarian aid enters the strip, after four soldiers were killed in a rocket attack by Hamas. </p><p>Hamas announced that it would accept the terms of a <b>ceasefire</b> and hostage release. However, Israeli officials said the proposed deal was different from the earlier text that they had agreed to. Israel sent a delegation to Cairo for further negotiations. </p><p><b>Turkey</b> announced that it would suspend trade with Israel, worth almost $7bn a year, until there was a ceasefire and the free flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. </p><p>Voting took place in <b>Chad’s</b> presidential election, which is almost certain to be won by Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno. Mr Déby took power unconstitutionally in 2021 after the death of his father, who had ruled since 1990. Russian troops have reportedly arrived in Chad to protect the president, while America said it would withdraw its forces, which had been helping Chad and the wider region fight jihadists.</p><p>Burundi, Congo, Rwanda and South Sudan joined an effort to develop a <b>railway</b> that will connect them via Uganda to Kenya’s port of Mombasa. Yet the countries involved have struggled to raise finance for the project amid a funding squeeze affecting much of Africa.</p><p>Gunmen killed two staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross and injured three more in South Darfur, <b>Sudan</b>, underlining the difficulties in providing aid to alleviate the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. </p><p>Security forces in <b>Libya</b> rescued at least 107 people who had been held captive and tortured while trying to make their way to Europe. Earlier this year the International Organisation for Migration reported that it had found a mass grave in Libya holding the bodies of at least 65 migrants.</p><p><b>Pakistan</b> said that a suicide-bomb attack on a dam in March that killed five Chinese engineers had been carried out by an Afghan bomber, a claim denied by the Taliban government in <b>Afghanistan</b>, which wants to establish closer ties with China. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have risen in recent months. Shortly before the dam attack Pakistan carried out air strikes in Afghanistan targeting what it said was a militant group. </p><h2>Every vote counts</h2><p>Narendra Modi, <b>India’s</b> prime minister, cast his vote in the third stage of the country’s general election, which concludes on June 4th when the ballots will be tallied. Turnout so far has been slightly lower than in the election of 2019, which may be explained by a searing heatwave that has seen temperatures top 45<sup>0</sup><small>C</small> (113<sup>0</sup><small>F</small>). </p><p>In <b>Canada</b> three men were arrested and charged in connection with the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist, near Vancouver last June. India had described Singh as a terrorist. The three suspects are Indian nationals who were living in Edmonton. India’s government denies any involvement in the killing. </p><p><b>Panama’s</b> presidential election was won by José Raúl Mulino. Mr Mulino was drafted in as the candidate of the right to replace Ricardo Martinelli, a former president, who was barred from running again because of an 11-year prison sentence for money-laundering. He is holed up in the Nicaraguan embassy, where he has claimed asylum. One of Mr Mulino’s biggest tasks will be tackling corruption.</p><figure><img src="static_images/be58d27e1529764c5eab08e1afcbb11e.jpg" alt="Evacuees ride in a loader after their homes were flooded at Eldorado do Sul, in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, May 7th 2024" class="te_img"/></figure><p>At least 100 people died in the worst flooding to hit the <b>Brazilian</b> state of Rio Grande do Sul in 80 years. More than 400,000 people lost electricity and nearly a third of the state’s 11m people were without water. </p><p>Joe Biden condemned <b>antisemitism</b> in a speech commemorating the Holocaust. The American president said that “too many people” are “denying, downplaying, rationalising, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7th” and “already forgetting… that it was Hamas that brutalised Israelis”. He also mentioned Jewish students at American colleges being “blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class”. Columbia University earlier cancelled its graduation ceremony amid the turmoil of pro-Palestinian protests on campus. In Europe police broke up demonstrations by pro-Palestinian activists at Berlin’s Free University and the University of Amsterdam. </p><p>Mike Johnson, the Republican <b>speaker</b> of the House of Representatives, easily survived an attempt by party rebels led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a radical right-winger, to oust him from his job. Democrats joined the bulk of Republicans to defeat the motion 359 to 43. </p><p>Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the centre of <b>Donald Trump’s</b> hush-money trial, <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/05/08/plenty-of-circumstantial-evidence-at-donald-trumps-trial">took the witness stand</a>. Giving lurid details, Ms Daniels described their sexual encounter in 2006, which she confirmed was consensual. Mr Trump is being tried for allegedly covering up a payment to Ms Daniels to stop her talking about the affair shortly before the presidential election in 2016. </p><p><b>Britain’s</b> ruling Conservative Party suffered heavy defeats in local elections. The opposition Labour Party was victorious in a parliamentary by-election held on the same day, with an impressive 26% swing from the Tories. A Conservative <small>MP</small> defected to Labour, the second to do so in two weeks. It is all grim news for Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, ahead of an election expected this autumn. </p><p>The Scottish National Party is also flailing. John Swinney assumed the party’s leadership unopposed, and thus became <b>Scotland’s</b> first minister, following the resignation of Humza Yousaf. Mr Swinney, a veteran politician, is seen as a safe pair of hands; he is the <small>SNP’</small>s third leader in just over a year.</p><p>The British government expelled Russia’s defence attaché for <b>spying</b>. The diplomatic status of several Russian-owned properties in Britain is also being removed because they have been used for intelligence purposes.</p><h2>In the reign of the tsar</h2><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b> was sworn in for a fifth term as Russia’s president, telling dignitaries at the ceremony that the recent election had “confirmed the correctness of the country’s course”. The day before the inauguration Mr Putin ordered the army to train for the deployment of tactical <b>nuclear weapons</b> in a military drill. </p><p>Ukraine’s domestic-intelligence service claimed to have uncovered another plot to assassinate <b>Volodymyr Zelensky</b>, the country’s president. It said two colonels in the State Protection Service, which provides security for the president, had been recruited by Russia and tasked with finding people to kill Mr Zelensky. </p><p>An <b>American soldier</b> was arrested in Russia, allegedly for stealing money from a woman he was having a relationship with. The soldier was on an unauthorised visit to Vladivostok, in Russia’s far east. A growing number of Americans have been detained in Russia over the past few years. </p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2024/05/09/politics" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2024/05/09/politics</a> </p>
