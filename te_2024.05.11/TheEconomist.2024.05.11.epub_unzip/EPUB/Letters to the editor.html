The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power.” The problem nevertheless goes beyond Tory obsession with parliamentary sovereignty (“take back control”) and the <small>ECHR.</small></p><p>As pointed out in the Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling of November 15th 2023, due consideration must be given to other instruments of international law (for example, the 1951 Refugee Convention) as well as domestic law (the Nationality, Immigration, and Asylum Act). When unwrapping the legal niceties of the Safety of Rwanda bill we are left with legal fiction (Rwanda is safe) and a desperate gamble to save the day at the next general election. What remains are inevitable legal challenges and the country’s reputation as a champion of the international rule of law lying in tatters. </p><p>John Donne famously wrote, “No man is an island”. Britain, an island, is embedded in a sea of international norms that it entered into of its own volition. Britain cannot go it alone. Its migrant policy and the plight of tens of thousands of asylum-seekers depends on compliance with the rules it willingly agreed to.</p><p><small>F.R.

It is not a membership association, but a private limited company. Nigel Farage owns 53% of the shares. He could thus sell his controlling interest in the “party” to anyone who cared to buy them.</p><p><small>David Holland</small><br/><i>Brighton</i></p><figure><img src="static_images/2fbb2c9245f9799653ea7d623cdfee8b.jpg" alt="A Giant Skycrane Helicopter transports a Transmission Structure." class="te_img"/></figure><h2>Electric markets</h2><p>I have worked in American energy policy for decades, and was enthused to see your coverage of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the interstate transmission of energy (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/04/25/the-most-important-climate-agency-youve-never-heard-of">What the <small>FERC</small></a><small>”,</small> April 27th). The article didn’t capture the importance of the final rule set to be released by the <small>FERC</small> on May 13th, the most significant decision the agency will make for a generation. At the heart of the issue is competitive markets versus monopoly power. </p><p><i>The Economist</i> routinely points out that free and fair markets deliver better outcomes for consumers. Transmission lines are no different. A study by Princeton University found that America will need to spend $2.5trn on additional capital investment by 2050 to reach its net-zero goals. Competitive bidding can lead to savings of 40%. </p><p>If all new transmission projects were competitively bid, ratepayers could save an estimated $840bn by 2050. If the <small>FERC</small> fails to embrace competition in its proposed rule, ratepayers and their wallets will feel the effects of the clean-energy transition for decades to come. This is a clear example of how free markets give consumers better outcomes. The <small>FERC</small> must endorse competition and so should <i>The Economist</i>.</p><p><small>Paul Cicio</small><br/>Chair <br/>Electricity Transmission Competition Coalition<br/><i>Washington,</i> <i><small>DC</small></i></p><figure><img src="static_images/4ba28d0b45d7acb6560e15fd74aa3625.jpg" alt="Cityscape of San Marino" class="te_img"/></figure><h2>San Marino and Ukraine</h2><p>I want to address recent speculation regarding San Marino’s foreign policy (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/04/24/the-tiny-republic-of-san-marino-is-alarmingly-friendly-to-russia">A weak link</a>”, April 27th). Misconceptions circulate about our nation’s position on various international matters, particularly concerning our relationship with Russia and our support for Ukraine. I want to emphasise that San Marino is an independent nation with its own foreign-policy principles. It has consistently demonstrated its commitment to upholding international law, promoting peace and supporting all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity, including Ukraine. </p><p>San Marino has taken concrete action to demonstrate solidarity with Ukraine and condemn Russia’s belligerence. We have unequivocally supported measures to counter Russian aggression, including voting in favour of sanctions against Russia and supporting initiatives to increase support for Ukraine, such as further paid-in capital for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. San Marino has engaged in diplomatic efforts to tackle the crisis and has aligned itself with the European Union and other partners in calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory and a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p><p>I want to assure you that San Marino remains steadfast in its dedication to promoting peace, stability and respect for the sovereignty of all nations.</p><p><small>Professor Maurizio </small><small>Bragagni </small><br/>Consul for San Marino<br/><i>London</i></p><figure><img src="static_images/a9a7c9dd36352ff692a2f4e47a5fc79a.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift performing during her Eras Tour" class="te_img"/></figure><h2>Bad blood</h2><p>You are wrong to ask “<a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/04/24/has-taylor-swift-peaked">Has Taylor Swift peaked?</a>”, (April 27th). As an 11-year-old British Swiftie, I think Ms Swift’s new album continues her tradition of “eras” (or moods, for non-Swifties). Most of the songs on any of her albums have the same beat and feel. “Fearless” is upbeat, whereas “Folklore” is more melancholy. In the same vein songs on “The Tortured Poets Department” are intentionally samey. </p><p>Having said all this, I still can’t persuade my dad to pay for an Eras tour ticket when she comes to town. </p><p><small>Anika Chopra </small><br/><i>Edinburgh</i></p><p>You claim that Ms Swift is boasting when she sings she is “so productive, it’s an art”. You then use this to argue that she should have employed “more selective editing” on her album. However, the full line, from “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart”, is actually “I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it’s an art.” Perhaps the album could have used more editing, but surely Ms Swift is not boasting and is instead using dry wit to express how she balanced her heartbreak with her writing output. </p><p><small>Charlotte Sadler</small><br/><i>London</i></p><p>I was enraged when I read your article. “Peaked” is a little much, no? What’s more, “mournful without being memorable” is not true in the slightest. I am literally humming “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?” as I write this. “Jarringly immature” and “unimaginative rhymes”; is that really what you want to say to your youngest generation of readers? </p><p>If you wanted me dead, you should’ve just said! </p><p><small>Sofia Margo</small><br/><i>Jersey City, New Jersey</i></p><p>Taylor Swift peaking by the age of 34 would be no surprise. None of the greats from the 1960s and 1970s (the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and so on) produced music of the highest quality beyond their mid-30s. Although they continued to record songs and sell albums, their most creative periods had passed. </p><p><small>Alan Whitworth</small><br/><i>London</i></p><p>Through the lens of longevity and popularity, Ms Swift has no equal. More than half of Americans admit to being a fan. She released her first album in 2006 and her triumphant Eras tour is still going. She overshadows the Beatles by almost every performance measure. Readers are simply asking, why you gotta be so mean?</p><p><small>Gavin Maitland</small><br/><i>Boston</i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/letters/2024/05/09/letters-to-the-editor" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/letters/2024/05/09/letters-to-the-editor</a> </p>
