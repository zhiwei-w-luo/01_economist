These include a flattering headshot, a title superficially stirring but actually meaningless (see Kamala Harris’s “The Truths We Hold” or Ron DeSantis’s “The Courage to Be Free”) and above all a text that is gently self-congratulatory and so insipid as to be entirely unmemorable. Kristi Noem, the telegenic Republican governor of South Dakota plainly angling to be Donald Trump’s running-mate, has released her own contribution to this grand literary tradition. It succeeds on only two of these three counts: the photo looks expensively posed (with a gilt clock and feminist placard in the foreground and an American flag in background), and the title (“No Going Back”) is suitably vapid. But the contents are unfortunately memorable in the worst possible ways.</p><p>Most surreal and disturbing is the story Ms Noem recounts, with some joy, of shooting one of her dogs. Cricket, the ill-fated animal, was a 14-month-old wirehair pointer who ruined a pheasant hunt that Ms Noem had planned for her lodge guests. The rumbustious Cricket then finished her day by attacking some chickens (“she was a trained assassin”) and attempting to bite the hand that fed her (Ms Noem’s). “I hated that dog,” the governor writes. She then decides to put her down by shooting her dead in a gravel pit. </p><aside><p><i>Stay up to date with our new daily update, <a href="https://www.economist.com/us-in-brief">The <small>US</small> in brief</a>, and our presidential <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls/">poll tracker</a>. </i></p><p><i>Read more of our coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/us-election-2024"><small>US</small> elections of 2024.</a></i></p></aside><p>Cricket was not the only casualty that day. On her way home, Ms Noem writes, she spots a billy goat that also needed disposing of. “He was nasty and mean, as most male goats are that are left uncastrated,” she explains. The impulsive deed, partially justified on account of the stench of the goat’s urine, is then performed in the same gravel pit. </p><p>On returning home, the governor recounts, her children asked her: “Hey, where’s Cricket?” (Her reply is not given.) This is all meant as a prelude to her penetrating insights about leadership: that it is not easy and sometimes messy. “I guess if I were a better politician I wouldn’t tell the story here,” she writes with some self-awareness, but not enough.</p><h2><b>Corpus Kristi</b></h2><p>This (along with a fictitious account of meeting with North Korea’s despot, Kim Jong Un, who she says underestimated her fortitude) has junked her chances of being on the Trump ticket. Ms Noem has given various disastrous media interviews defending herself by, among other things, suggesting that Joe Biden ought to euthanise his own dog, which had a penchant for biting Secret Service agents before being sent off to an undisclosed location. The public-relations disaster rather resembles the misadventures of Sarah Palin—the former Alaska governor chosen to be John McCain’s running-mate in 2008—except that Ms Noem will probably never actually enjoy the pomp and perks of a vice-presidential nomination.</p><p>Various would-be vice-presidents flew to Palm Beach, Florida, last weekend for a real-life version of “The Bachelor”, in which Mr Trump is the eligible fellow and the prize is a posh four-year stay in Washington with a decent actuarial chance of acquiring the nuclear launch codes. Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, was there, as were several senatorial suitors like J.D. Vance of Ohio, Tim Scott of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida. Lesser-known lawmakers who are also under consideration, including Elise Stefanik and Byron Donalds, showed up for the auditions as well. </p><p>Ms Noem happened to be there, too. No incidents were reported. Any animals in the vicinity must have been safely in their kennels, or on their best behaviour. <span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/05/09/how-kristi-noem-missed-her-shot-to-be-vice-president" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/05/09/how-kristi-noem-missed-her-shot-to-be-vice-president</a> </p>
