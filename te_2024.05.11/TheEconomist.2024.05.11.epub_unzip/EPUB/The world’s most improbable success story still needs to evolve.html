Western politicians envy its sky-high living standards and its efficient civil service. In the emerging world it is a lesson in how to escape poverty. Yet the island state of 6m now finds itself confronting three of the world’s greatest challenges: tension between the West and China, ageing and climate change. True, Singapore is so small that its policies cannot always be easily copied elsewhere. But how it handles its problems will still be worth watching. Part of the answer needs to be more open politics.</p><p>Singapore’s destiny is in the hands of a new leader, Lawrence Wong, whom <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/05/08/an-interview-with-lawrence-wong-singapores-next-pm">we interview this week</a>. On May 15th he becomes prime minister, as Lee Hsien Loong steps down. That will end what was, in effect, 59 years of rule by the Lee family (Goh Chok Tong ran things for 14 years, but even then a Lee was waiting in the wings, while another stayed on as “senior minister”). Mr Lee’s father, Lee Kuan Yew, turned a colonial entrepot with seething racial politics into a gleaming metropolis. His formula included openness to trade, geopolitical neutrality and a technocratic government; less attractively, he sought to destroy opponents and muzzled free speech. Singapore’s <small>GDP</small> per person is an astonishing $88,000.</p><p>Many of Singapore’s strengths are still on display. Relatively few of its citizens died during the pandemic. Its charms as a financial hub have been amplified by China’s clampdown in Hong Kong. Singapore aspires to be neutral ground in a new cold war—a Vienna for the 2020s. It welcomes American warships but insists it is open to all navies, including China’s. As tech wars rage, it hosts the regional headquarters of Silicon Valley firms but also those of China’s Alibaba and ByteDance (which owns TikTok, now the subject of an American divestment order on national-security grounds). Having it both ways is a national doctrine that has served Singapore well. </p><p>Yet Mr Wong faces looming dangers. First, geopolitics could create a rupture. Tech dominates Singapore’s manufacturing exports, so a full-blown decoupling of the West and China would shrink the economy by 10%. If America imposed sanctions on China it would put Singapore in a dreadful bind. Were it to enforce them, Chinese money would flee. If it refused to, America might limit access to the dollar financial system, the anchor of Singapore’s banking and currency arrangements.</p><p>Second, the city-state is greying, fast. Rising health-care costs and a shrinking workforce will hurt growth. The answer is more migration of both cheap labourers and skilled foreigners (already 40% of residents are non-citizens). But that creates tensions as housing costs rise and natives worry that the white-collar jobs market is too competitive. The social fabric is being tested in other ways. Young people want a less uptight society. Many are <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/05/09/in-south-east-asia-the-war-in-gaza-is-roiling-emotions">angry about Gaza</a>. </p><p>The final challenge is climate change. Singapore knows all about physical constraints: 20% of its land is reclaimed and it imports much of its water. But as a low-lying island it faces a shrinking perimeter and more flooding. And its economy is energy intensive, so emissions per person are high.</p><p>Mr Wong has good instincts on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/05/08/singapore-has-achieved-astounding-economic-success">economy</a>. His priority is for it to remain as open as possible. Embracing trade and capital flows means workers are exposed to the latest technologies. This is why median wages have risen more than in most rich countries. Growth generates new resources to solve problems and creates new industries, allowing diversification away from obsolete or sensitive sectors. But openness involves creative destruction, with sudden shocks and shifting jobs. </p><p>So Mr Wong also emphasises resilience. Singapore is expanding a negative income tax to help the poor and to retrain workers affected by technological change. It is investing $75bn to protect itself from climate change, for example with sea walls. In finance it insists on high capital buffers and currency reserves to absorb turbulence. Economic openness plus enhanced resilience is Singapore’s new formula.</p><p>Where Mr Wong should go a lot further is in political liberalisation. Singapore has evolved beyond the abrasive and authoritarian era of Lee Kuan Yew—but not enough. His ruling People’s Action Party (<small>PAP</small>), in power continuously since independence, argues that Western-style liberalism could lead to polarising racial politics. Yet endless one-party dominance has risks, too. A climate of fear about overstepping boundaries throttles not only outside scrutiny of the <small>PAP</small> but also new ideas. Corruption and jobs for the boys can rise. And the inevitable divisions in a hypermodern society undergoing disruption can become hard to air or resolve.</p><p>Mr Wong has already undertaken a public consultation on Singapore’s direction. But he should encourage a robust public discourse, in which the ruling party is less prickly about criticism and outside ideas. He should also remove the remaining constraints on the opposition, by making constituency boundaries independently determined and allowing a freedom of information act. Openness, resilience and more contestable politics will help Singapore continue to thrive. <span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/05/09/the-worlds-most-improbable-success-story-still-needs-to-evolve" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/05/09/the-worlds-most-improbable-success-story-still-needs-to-evolve</a> </p>
