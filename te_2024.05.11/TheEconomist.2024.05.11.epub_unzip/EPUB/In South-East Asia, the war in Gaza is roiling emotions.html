The first two have Muslim-majority populations, and Singapore, largely ethnic-Chinese, has a Muslim minority of 16%. As on campuses in America and in street protests in Europe, the sympathies among those who are concerned about the conflict—and who in Singapore include many young non-Muslims—are for Palestinians suffering from Israel’s heavy-handed prosecution of the war. </p><p>Strong feelings have thus made the war a political challenge in ways that are connected, but also vary from country to country. Malaysia’s prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, is by far the most strident leader in South-East Asia in support of the Palestinians. Mr Anwar has decried what he says was Western pressure to condemn Hamas, the hardline group ruling Gaza that started the war with a brutal raid on Israel. </p><p>While Palestine maintains an official embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Hamas can boast an unofficial one. Mr Anwar’s government has banned Israeli ships from docking. Politicians join rallies against the West’s backing of Israel. </p><p>Mr Anwar’s stance is no surprise. He has long espoused Palestinian independence. Malaysia itself has refused to recognise Israel. Meanwhile his chief challenge comes from <small>PAS</small>, an ultra-conservative Islamic group and the largest party in parliament. He cannot afford to let <small>PAS</small> outflank him on religious issues, or he loses power.</p><p>For now Mr Anwar sees little downside in his pro-Palestinian, anti-American stance. His government, keen on Western investment, says it is open for business. Yet more stridency may make investors wonder. As it is, Malaysia’s religiously tolerant ethnic minorities are growing more uncomfortable with the increased religiosity that the Gaza war has helped feed.</p><p>In Indonesia feelings also run high. Yet the rhetoric among political leaders is relatively restrained. True, the government of Joko Widodo has condemned Israel’s imminent offensive on Rafah, Hamas’s last stronghold. And, in a recent opinion piece for <i>The Economist</i> that was widely cheered back home, the president-elect, Prabowo Subianto, condemned the West for caring more about Ukrainians’ fate than Palestinians’. Yet that is tame stuff compared with Mr Anwar: unlike Malaysia’s denial of Israel, Mr Prabowo calls for talks and a two-state solution.</p><p>What factors explain the difference? Indonesia’s ties with Israel are closer than the elites like to let on. They include purchases of Israeli tech and weaponry. Before the war, secret talks looked likely to establish ties between the two countries, starting with reciprocal trade offices. Although Mr Prabowo denies Islamists’ claims that he is chummy with Israel, he is in little danger of being outﬂanked by hardliners, having absorbed key Muslim political groupings in his coalition. Domestic considerations count.</p><p>Squeezed between Indonesia and Malaysia, Singapore has close security ties with Israel—two small states encircled by danger. Yet Gaza greatly complicates the relationship, on account of domestic feeling. As Lawrence Wong, the incoming prime minister, told <i>The Economist</i> this week, even though the war in Ukraine carries economic consequences for Singapore, at an emotional level it resonates little. </p><p>By contrast, though Gaza has had negligible economic effect, it has had “a much higher level of resonance”, given the plight of Palestinians. The concern is that communal tensions might surface in ways that strain Singapore’s famed social and religious harmony. That, says the government, is why pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been banned. Christians, who are generally pro-Israel and account for 19% of the population, would demand their own protests, thereby bringing religious discord into the open. The government also fears that Malaysian stridency could cross the bridge that joins the two countries and foster extremism in Singapore.</p><p>The necessary response, Mr Wong says, is “to go out [and] explain to our people the positions that Singapore has taken”. That includes condemning Israel’s heavy hand, urging for a ceasefire and a two-state solution and providing aid to beleaguered Palestinians. Those steps are surely right in themselves. But in South-East Asia, when dealing with a distant war, never ignore factors that are close-to-hand. <span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><b>Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia: </b><br/><i><a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/05/02/meet-the-maharajas-of-the-worlds-biggest-democracy">Meet the maharajas of the world’s biggest democracy</a> (May 2nd)</i><br/><i><a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/04/25/the-family-feud-that-holds-the-philippines-back">The family feud that holds the Philippines back</a> (Apr 25th)</i><br/><i><a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/04/18/lawrence-wong-will-be-only-the-fourth-pm-in-singapores-history">Lawrence Wong will be only the fourth PM in Singapore’s history</a> (Apr 18th)</i></p><p><i>Also: How the Banyan column <a href="https://www.economist.com/column-names">got its name</a></i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/05/09/in-south-east-asia-the-war-in-gaza-is-roiling-emotions" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/05/09/in-south-east-asia-the-war-in-gaza-is-roiling-emotions</a> </p>
