In most of the world we shared our thoughts on the fracturing of the liberal international order. At first glance, the world economy looks reassuringly resilient. But a deeper look reveals fragility. For years the order that has governed the global economy since the second world war has been eroded. Today it is close to collapse. A worrying number of triggers could set off a descent into anarchy, where might is right and war is once again the resort of great powers. Even if it never comes to conflict, the effect on the economy of a breakdown in norms could be fast and brutal.</p><figure><img src="static_images/46e65f0794bafc0c52dd7cba2b7fed5c.jpg" alt="None" class="te_img"/></figure><p><b>Leader</b>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/05/09/the-liberal-international-order-is-slowly-coming-apart">The liberal international order is slowly coming apart</a><br/><b>Briefing</b>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/05/09/the-worlds-economic-order-is-breaking-down">Critics will miss globalisation when it is gone</a><br/><b>Special report</b>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024-05-11">Deglobalisation of finance</a><br/><b>International</b>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/05/09/the-worlds-rules-based-order-is-cracking">Lawyers are trying to save laws meant to tame violent rulers</a></p><hr/><p>In Britain, however, we focused on the Labour Party and its relationship with business. The transformation of the party’s political fortunes since the last general election has been accompanied by a fervent romancing of business. Polls of corporate leaders suggest they would rather see Labour in power than the Conservatives. Yet probe those leaders in private, and they profess alarming uncertainty about what lies in store under a Labour prime minister. At the heart of Sir Keir Starmer’s pitch is a grand bargain: the restoration of basic governing principles in return for companies’ swallowing of big changes, notably in labour markets. A great deal is at stake for Labour and for Britain in getting this bargain right.</p><figure><img src="static_images/b79dc1e112df533ae50ccda5fb42e186.jpg" alt="None" class="te_img"/></figure><p><b>Leader</b>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/05/09/what-companies-can-expect-if-labour-wins-britains-election">What companies can expect if Labour wins Britain’s election</a><br/><b>Britain</b>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/05/09/the-labour-partys-grand-bargain-with-business">The Labour Party’s grand bargain with business</a></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2024/05/09/this-weeks-covers" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2024/05/09/this-weeks-covers</a> </p>
