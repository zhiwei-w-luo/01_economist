Suicide is a serious matter with an impact far beyond the person whose life is ended. Friends and caregivers experience remorse and guilt. Once legalised, assisted dying rapidly extends to those unable to defend themselves. </p><p>Regardless of how many restrictions are put in place, permission rapidly extends to non-terminal patients, because once a “right” to suicide is conceded, how can such a right be denied to others? In Canada more than 60,000 individuals have ended their life by assisted dying since legalisation in 2016. The rates are increasing, and are expected to account for 5% of all deaths by 2025. In some urban areas of the Netherlands 12-14% of deaths occur by that means. In Belgium annual rates continue to increase by 10-15% a year. At highest risk are people unable to afford or obtain necessary care as well as those with a mental illness. In Canada in 2022 alone, 2,264 individuals terminated their lives because of loneliness; 323 persons died unable to obtain palliative care and 196 disabled persons died with inadequate support.</p><p>We understand that those supporting assisted dying are motivated by sincere compassion, but it is misguided. Every terminally ill, suffering patient should invoke compassion, but suicide is not the answer. Rather, we must strive to improve end-of-life care and work to obtain the resources to relieve each individual person’s pain. </p><p><small>Dr Eve Slater</small><br/>Professor of clinical medicine<br/>Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons<br/>Columbia University<br/><i>New York</i></p><p>To fully grasp a rights claim like the right to die, you need to go beyond consent to think about the social, economic and psychological conditions required for individuals to act autonomously.</p><p>Evidence from jurisdictions where assisted dying is legal reveals how ableism, ageism and diseasism co-exist with strained health-care systems, underfunded palliative care and patient fears about not being a burden. These forms of oppression affect the freedom of people contemplating assisted dying, but not necessarily their choice to ask for an assisted death.</p><p>Going beyond a freedom/coercion dichotomy is important for Britain and any country trying to keep essential ethical ambiguities alive when it comes to legislating on the radical nature of helping another person die.</p><p><small>Professor Anna Elsner </small><br/><small>Dr Vanessa Rampton</small><br/>University of St Gallen<br/><i>St Gallen, Switzerland</i></p><figure><img src="static_images/365f56625a2614863b0993d9ce65c695.jpg" alt="A hand with a green glove pulls the knot on a hearbeat line to make it flat." class="te_img"/></figure><p>Given your premise that the case for assisted dying involves a basic human right, any restrictions on this right are random and arbitrary. Assisted dying should be available to anyone who chooses, no matter what their life circumstances or the reasons for their choice. Unless you are prepared to accept the dystopian conclusion of your own premise then the argument for assisted dying, if any, must begin at a different starting point.</p><p><small>Erik Wilson</small><br/><i>Beverley, East Yorkshire</i></p><p>In 2020 I was diagnosed as having terminal metastatic cancer, and my oncologist told me that I had only a few months to live. Therefore I was declared eligible to die with medical assistance, which I fully intended to have. The strange thing is that now, four years later, here I am still alive. If I had died with medical assistance in 2020, I would have missed four precious years with my family.</p><p>So why do I support medical assistance in dying? The answer is that in Canada it is available not only to people with terminal illnesses but also to people who are experiencing intolerable suffering from an incurable (not terminal) illness. I am not yet experiencing intolerable suffering, but I know that I will be. And when that time comes I will choose to die peacefully and with dignity, which is what medical assistance in dying provides.</p><p>I just wish that everyone had the right to choose whether or not to have medically assisted dying. Too many people throughout the world are needlessly left to experience intolerable suffering and unbearable pain.</p><p><small>Dr Patricia Morton</small><br/><i>Peterborough, Canada</i></p><p>Our father went through the Medical Assistance in Dying process in June 2022, three weeks after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. It gave our father agency over his own death and allowed him to die with dignity and without fear of extreme discomfort and pain in his last days and weeks. It also gave him peace of mind. He died well and the last thing he heard was how much my sister and I loved him. </p><p><small>Ian Bird</small><br/><i>Vienna</i></p><figure><img src="static_images/3721925b728d988a8442aec022b36202.jpg" alt="An illegal catch seized by Sea Shepherd and Gabon authorities off Gabon" class="te_img"/></figure><h2>Protecting fishermen</h2><p>Your article about China’s fishing fleet causing havoc off Africa’s coasts chimes with the stark reality that we have come across at Stella Maris, an international maritime charity (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/04/11/chinas-fishing-fleet-is-causing-havoc-off-africas-coasts">Slavery at sea</a>”, April 13th). Many of the exploited fishermen in situations such as those you mentioned are sole breadwinners, simply trying to earn a living for themselves and to support their families. The financial strain and psychological trauma they suffer can be devastating and long-lasting.</p><p>We have intervened in many cases, including in Kenya and South Africa, where fishing crews have been mistreated. A large percentage of our crisis casework involves vessels registered in either China or Taiwan. Achieving satisfactory resolutions, if we can, for these crews can often take months or even years, navigating complex legal issues.</p><p>In Mombasa, Stella Maris stepped in to provide emergency support to 16 desperate fishermen who had been left in a perilous situation when their fishing vessel was abandoned by unscrupulous owners. Similarly in Cape Town, a group of fishermen had been physically abused, denied medical care, forced to wear torn protective clothing, deprived of sufficient food and water and not paid their wages. Our team stepped in to provide medicines and food. Thankfully, the outcomes in these two cases were positive. There remain many that are not.</p><p><small>Tim Hill</small><br/>Chief executive officer<br/>Stella Maris <small>UK</small><br/><i>London</i></p><h2>Military service</h2><p>With 425,000 troops, Turkey’s armed forces are the second-largest contingent in <small>NATO</small> and the conscription system in Turkey could set an example to other countries that have a problem recruiting soldiers (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/04/17/would-you-really-die-for-your-country">Raining on their parade</a>”, April 20th). Turkish males between the ages of 20 and 41 have to undertake six to 12 months of compulsory service in the armed forces. Two factors make this manageable. </p><p>First, non-commissioned officers and privates doing military service are not deployed to counter-terrorism operations or conflict zones unless “gravely required”. Second, after a month of service, conscripts have the option to pay 182,000 lira ($5,600) to opt out of the rest of their stint. This is known as “paid military service.”</p><p><small>Gokercan Goker</small><br/><i>Washington, <small>DC</small></i></p><figure><img src="static_images/0917c7e4912670acd80dd02a4a8c694b.jpg" alt="Soldiers make their way through an obstacle course at a public presentation in Dresden, Germany" class="te_img"/></figure><p>You argue that conscription is being considered because many countries “struggle to recruit enough soldiers” and may be reluctant to do so because “conscripting young people infringes harshly on their liberty”.</p><p>There are other considerations. At a formative age, youth are offered a rare occasion to interact with people of different social class, ethnicity and religion. This enhances social trust, one of the strongest indicators of prosperity. Studies show that military service improves political engagement. Participants take a greater interest in political affairs, are more likely to engage in debate and are exposed to those with different opinions. This leads to the kind of deliberation, sense of shared purpose and ability to intermediate social consensus, fundamental to well-functioning democracies.</p><p>Conscription may not be a magic bullet, but the most prosperous democratic nations inform us that it can be a positive centripetal force. Perhaps some infringement on our liberty would be a valuable reminder that freedom is as much about asserting our rights as fulfilling our duties.</p><p><small>R. James Breiding</small><br/><i>Zurich</i></p><figure><img src="static_images/0b634fdf080f297ed746981079756c51.jpg" alt="Teenagers hang on to their smartphones." class="te_img"/></figure><h2>Isolating our children</h2><p>“<a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/04/17/what-is-screen-time-doing-to-children">Time for a digital detox?</a>” (April 20th) is the latest in a long line of articles on children who overuse smartphones and social media. What surprises me is that none of these commentators join the dots between young people’s attachment to their devices and the annihilation of their recreational activities. </p><p>There used to be free music lessons, youth clubs, art classes, football and cricket pitches. Where are they now? Abandoned, abolished, cut because of austerity. When recreational amenities are taken away what do children do? Go on their screens. In Camden, a London borough, it now costs £99 an hour ($123) to knock a ball about on a “public” pitch. Nobody, young, old or adolescent, finds it easy to strike up a conversation with a stranger in a bare room. But sitting next to each other in a life-drawing class, mixing tracks together in a studio, changing after a sports game, that’s where conversations begin. Where these facilities are offered and free, they are seized on. </p><p>Isn’t it time to consider something radical, like asking big tech companies to pay some tax that might then be deployed to bring back joy, leisure and friendship to a miserable and anxious generation?</p><p><small>Sheila Hayman</small><br/>Advisory board<br/>Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy<br/><i>Cambridge, Cambridgeshire</i></p><h2>A ranked outsider</h2><p>No article on Robert F. Kennedy junior (<a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2024/04/10/robert-f-kennedy-junior-doesnt-care-if-he-condemns-america-to-trump"><i>1843</i></a>, April 10th) is complete without mentioning that if ranked-choice voting were to be used in American presidential elections it would put an end to any concern that <small>RFK</small> might hand the election to Donald Trump. Mr Kennedy’s voters could mark a second choice of Joe Biden or Mr Trump, and then <small>RFK</small> would have no effect whatsoever on the election outcome. </p><p><small>Jesse Stone</small><br/><i>Boulder Creek, California</i></p><p>For we of the mushy middle, it is hard not to be enthralled by your masterful exposé of <small>RFK</small> junior, who “doesn’t care if he condemns America to Trump”. What’s not to like about a candidate who is neither a malevolent gangster nor a neoprene sock puppet? The man is colourful, unfiltered, authentic, weird and engaging. A man of the 1970s, like me? A wave of nausea invades my soul at either alternative. <small>RFK,</small> I’m listening, man!</p><p><small>David Abrahamson</small><br/><i>Warrenton, Virginia</i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/letters/2024/05/02/letters-to-the-editor" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/letters/2024/05/02/letters-to-the-editor</a> </p>
