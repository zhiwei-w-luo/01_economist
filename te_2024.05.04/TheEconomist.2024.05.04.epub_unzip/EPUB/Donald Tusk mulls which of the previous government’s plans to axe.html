She has put off repairs since 2017, when she heard that the government would build a mega-airport on the site of her farm in Podoryszew, 50km west of Warsaw. The project has been put on ice since Poland’s populist Law and Justice (<small>P</small>i<small>S</small>) party, which championed it, was voted out in late 2023. <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>’s centre-right successors have promised more fiscal responsibility. But scrapping mega-projects means sunk costs and dashed hopes.</p><p>The liberal government that took over in December inherited a mixed bag of investments. Some are too far along to cancel, such as a shipping channel in an out-of-the-way lagoon that cost over 2bn zloty ($495m) to build. Despite its dubious value, Donald Tusk, the prime minister, said he would finish the final 900 metres. Other projects can still be reconsidered. An effort to produce a Polish electric car (a partnership with Geely, a Chinese firm) has cost the state some 500m zlotys since 2016. Land for a factory has been bought, but construction keeps getting put off. In April the government said it needed to rethink the investment’s “formula”.</p><figure><img src="static_images/32ce2412d8b8b9b0d35408b2a9018c3c.png" alt="None" class="te_img"/></figure><p>The main question is what to do about the Central Communication Port (<small>CPK</small>), an air-rail hub. The previous government envisaged an airport initially handling 34m passengers a year and 100m later (comparable to London’s Heathrow), connected to some 2,000km of new high-speed railways. It aimed to make Poland the transport centre of eastern Europe. But detractors argue that the country cannot afford to spend over 155bn zloty on a bet that may not pay off. The project’s new boss, Maciej Lasek, says the plan he inherited was driven by national pride rather than good economic sense. A six-month audit will decide whether the money would be better spent on regional airports and rail.</p><p>The government now thinks <small>CPK</small> could open in 2032 at the earliest. In the meantime, on April 30th it announced it would expand Warsaw’s current airport as a “bridging measure”. That airport carried 24m passengers last year, near its capacity. The 2.4bn zloty expansion would boost it to 30m in 2029. Predictably, <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> attacked the decision. But so did some business figures. Maciej Wilk, a former executive at <small>LOT</small>, Poland’s national carrier, called it an “infrastructural coup d’état”. The Council of Polish Global Entrepreneurs (<small>RPPG</small>), a lobby group, urged Mr Tusk to take a more “farsighted approach” to <small>CPK</small>. </p><p>Dropping <small>CPK</small> would be painful. The treasury has spent billions of zloty to design the hub and buy land. There is a social cost too. Like Ms Zimmerman, thousands of residents in the area have had their lives uprooted. In Nowy Oryszew, a village in its centre, a third of the 60 houses have been voluntarily vacated, according to Miroslaw Tondera, the mayor.</p><p><small>CPK</small> is widely seen as the brainchild of <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>, but it is also popular. In a poll in February, 58% supported the idea. “Poles feel they are a nation that does not get what it deserves,” says Jacek Nizinkiewicz, political editor of <i>Rzeczpospolita</i>, a daily. “The project addressed those unfulfilled ambitions.” And though risky, long-term bets can pay off. The <small>LNG </small>terminal in Swinoujscie, approved in 2006 under <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> and completed in 2015 by Civic Platform, Mr Tusk’s erstwhile party, has helped wean Poland off Russian gas. Now both parties squabble over bragging rights. <span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/cafe-europa">Café Europa</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/05/02/donald-tusk-mulls-which-of-the-previous-governments-plans-to-axe" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/05/02/donald-tusk-mulls-which-of-the-previous-governments-plans-to-axe</a> </p>
