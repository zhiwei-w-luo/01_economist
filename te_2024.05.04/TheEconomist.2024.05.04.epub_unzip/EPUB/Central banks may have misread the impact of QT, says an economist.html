This involves central banks either not reinvesting maturing government debt or, in the Bank of England’s case, selling bonds to shrink their balance-sheets. Partly as a result of central banks’ relative absence from government-bond markets as they implement <small>QT</small>, yields—which move inversely to prices—have been rising.</p><p><small>QT</small> is the reversal of quantitative easing (<small>QE</small>), which is the expansion of central-bank balance-sheets to stimulate the economy, done by purchasing government debt to bring down long-term interest rates. Central banks adopted <small>QE</small> when policy rates hit the floor and could not be lowered further during the global financial crisis and, a decade later, the covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>The broad conclusion from the first two years of <small>QT</small> is that the policy has worked. Central banks say they can shrink their balance-sheets without disrupting financial markets or causing a substantial tightening of financial conditions. This view has already led the <small>ECB</small> and the Bank of England to accelerate the pace of <small>QT</small>.</p><p>Could central banks’ confidence that <small>QT</small> effects are only small be misplaced? Bond markets have suffered significant sell-offs while central banks engaged in <small>QT</small>. But long-term interest rates depend on both the future path of monetary policy and the “term premium”, the compensation investors require for the risk that interest rates may change over a bond’s life. Term premia are a function of supply and demand in bond markets, and therefore of <small>QT</small>. The argument typically made is that the sell-off in bond markets is a consequence mainly of changes in monetary-policy expectations, not term premia. It is, however, difficult to disentangle the effects of <small>QT</small> from expectations of policy-rate rises. It’s hard to know what level bond yields would have reached in the absence of <small>QT</small>. </p><p>Indeed, estimates of <small>QT</small>’s effect on yields vary widely: from as little as the ten basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) in Britain that Bank of England surveys of market participants have suggested, to as much as the 60-70 basis points in the euro area estimated by the <small>ECB</small>. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32321">Recent research</a> by three economists shows that the effect of an individual <small>QT</small> announcement averaged 4-8 basis points, but the aggregate effects of such announcements have averaged 21 basis points to date, ranging from almost nothing to 69 basis points in different countries. An alternative approach is to reverse-engineer estimates of <small>QT</small> from econometric models of <small>QE</small>. This suggests overall effects of 30 basis points (based on <small>QT</small> equivalent to 3% of <small>GDP</small>).</p><p>The lack of more precise estimates should perhaps not be surprising. Even the effects of <small>QE</small>, on which there has been a decade of research, are not well understood. A recent report by the Treasury Committee of the British Parliament called <small>QT</small> “a leap in the dark”. </p><p>The mid-range in current estimates, 30 basis points per 3%-of-<small>GDP</small>-worth of <small>QT</small>, seems in line with the conventional view that the effects are likely to be modest. The argument goes that once <small>QT</small> is announced and priced by markets, implementation will not raise bond yields further. Yet there are several reasons why the overall effects could be larger. </p><p><small>QT</small> is not happening in isolation, but in an environment of high government deficits. Central-bank policy is therefore increasing the amount of net government debt that the private sector needs to purchase. Modern finance theory says that the yield curve—the line drawn through interest rates on comparable securities with different maturities—is just a reflection of future monetary-policy expectations. Sensing the opportunity to profit, investors will arbitrage away any excess demand for or supply of debt that deviates from their monetary-policy expectations. This is counterintuitive, because it implies that supply and demand don’t affect bond prices. </p><p>But this theory was designed for normal times, when fluctuations in excess bond supply are small, not for today’s world of high public bond ownership. For example, the share of Bunds (German government bonds) available for private-sector purchase has fallen from 72% in 2011 to around 40% now. Given such large public ownership, yields probably don’t reflect the levels that would clear a purely private market for government debt. Allowing the private sector to buy more government debt can therefore lead to higher yields over time, beyond the initial effect of <small>QT</small> when it is announced.</p><p>The absence of central banks—all-weather, price-insensitive buyers—in bond markets will gradually raise yield-curve term premia. This is the component that is affected by the balance of bond supply and demand as a result of <small>QT</small>. And higher term premia mean higher yields.</p><p>International spillovers may amplify the effect of <small>QT</small>. Bond yields have a stronger correlation across countries than policy rates do. The cross-border transmission of <small>QT</small> is therefore stronger than that of conventional monetary policy. When calculating the cumulative effect of <small>QT</small> in a given country, these spillovers need to be taken into account as well. </p><p>Factor in all these effects and the current pace of <small>QT</small>, and the result is likely to be long-term interest rates that are 50-100 basis points higher than if there had been no <small>QT</small>. Usually, 100-150 basis points of conventional monetary-policy-rate tightening would be required to achieve such an outcome. So much for <small>QT</small>’s effects being small.</p><p>These effects have important implications for the monetary-policy stance of the major central banks. Simply put, they may have underestimated the impact of <small>QT</small> on financial conditions and their economies. Monetary policy is likely to be tighter than indicated by the policy rate alone. Central banks are committed to continuing <small>QT</small> while they engage in policy-rate cuts. To meet their inflation targets, they may therefore have to cut policy rates faster than they previously expected.<span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Tomasz Wieladek is chief European economist at T.
