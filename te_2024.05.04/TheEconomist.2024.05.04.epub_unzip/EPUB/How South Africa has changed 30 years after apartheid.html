The choice of location showed that South Africa’s president-in-waiting had lost none of his knack for symbolism after his 27 years as the world’s most famous political prisoner. After casting his ballot Mandela walked to the nearby grave of John Dube, the first president of his party, the African National Congress (<small>ANC</small>). “I have come to report, Mr President,” he said in his resonant timbre, “that South Africa is now free.” </p><p>Thirty years later South Africa is undeniably a free country. The hidebound evil of apartheid is gone. A liberal constitution helps ensure South Africans can say what they want, move where they like and marry whom they love. A basic welfare state has raised millions out of indigence. South Africans socialise more with people of other races. More than three-quarters say that there is more that unites them than divides them, according to the South African Reconciliation Barometer Survey (<small>SARBS</small>), a biennial poll. Elections on May 29th will be free and fair. </p><p>Such progress was not guaranteed. Some feared that South Africa would descend into civil war or autocracy. Neighbouring Zimbabwe became a hyperinflationary dictatorship some 27 years after the end of white rule. </p><figure><img src="static_images/cbc7777f030dcbcbbe786967f4e2c559.png" alt="None" class="te_img"/></figure><p>Yet as South Africans prepare to cast their ballot they are doing so in a despondent mood. Just 29% say their life will get better over the next five years. Two decades ago more than twice as many South Africans were satisfied with democracy than were dissatisfied—today those shares have flipped (see chart 1). No less than 79% of respondents say political leaders cannot be trusted, up from 21% just a decade ago. Since roughly 2010 steadily fewer South Africans have said that they think race relations are better now than they were in 1994 (see chart 2).</p><p>These attitudes are the product of South Africans’ material circumstances. Democracy has been a game of two halves: the first 15 years saw widespread improvements in people’s lives, but the latest 15 have been grim. Unemployment has risen from 20% in 2008 to 32% today. <small>GDP</small> per person is lower than in 2008 after adjusting for inflation. The murder rate is at its highest in 20 years. Last year saw record power cuts. Researchers behind the South African Social Attitudes Survey (<small>SASAS</small>) note that last year’s polling found the highest-ever levels of ambivalence about whether democracy was preferable to autocracy. Some 72% say they would give up voting if an unelected government could ensure they had jobs, security and housing, notes Afrobarometer, a pan-African pollster. </p><figure><img src="static_images/9e1f8f9ad637743c28e14187909627ad.png" alt="None" class="te_img"/></figure><p>All these frustrations explain why the <small>ANC</small> will struggle to retain its parliamentary majority for the first time since 1994. Many in South Africa are focused narrowly on which parties will join a coalition (almost certainly led by the <small>ANC</small>) to form the next government. But the 30th anniversary raises a more profound question: how long can Mandela’s vision of South Africa survive when so many people have not enjoyed the benefits of democracy? </p><p>To answer that, <i>The Economist</i> took a Mandela-themed journey, visiting places of importance in his life. The first stop was Qunu, where Mandela spent his childhood. The poor village, scattered across verdant hills and valleys, offers a lesson in how different generations see democracy. </p><p>Elderly residents meet in a ramshackle house to share their views on life since apartheid. Florence Matikinca recalls hiding from police whenever she travelled without the pass that controlled blacks’ movement. “There are now no borders within South Africa,” says Ncwali Xozwa. Qunu was part of the Transkei, one of ten ethnic “homelands” meant to limit the number of black people living in white-run South Africa. “We can raise our voices and we can protest without fear,” she adds.</p><h2>Granny grants</h2><p>Those in their dotage praise the expansion of welfare benefits known as grants. (Eligible pensioners get about 2,200 rand or $118 a month.) Spending on grants has risen from about 2% of <small>GDP</small> in 1994 to almost 4%. By that measure South Africa’s social safety-net is one of the most generous globally. Today 47% of the population receives a grant, up from about 6% in 1994. </p><p>But the generation “born free” after 1994 have less to celebrate—and a different frame of reference. According to the latest census the share of households without access to piped water fell from 20% in 1996 to 9% in 2022. Those living in formal housing and with electricity rose respectively from 65% to 89% and 58% to 95%. But the progress was not linear: most of the gains came in the 1990s and 2000s. And in many local municipalities infrastructure is deteriorating as a result of corruption, crime and mismanagement. Residents of Qunu have not had running water for four years. </p><p>Unemployment intensified as born-frees came of age. Since 2008 the number of employed has grown by 2.3m, while the number of working-age South Africans has risen by 9.5m. The unemployment rate for those aged 15-34 is 44%.</p><p>David Everett of the University of Witwatersrand recently published an updated version of a “youth marginalisation” index that he first produced in 1992. The index combines objective data on measures like joblessness with subjective surveys of well-being. Tragically he found that “fewer young people are doing as well as their counterparts from 30 years ago.” </p><p>Grants are a sign of failure as well as success. The World Bank reckons that for every recipient another South African also depends on that grant. In Qunu, Nontsikelelo Jozana supports four grandchildren with her stipend. “They are all sitting around,” she sighs. Some pensioners hide their money in case it is stolen for drugs.</p><figure><iframe/></figure><p>Poor schooling does not help. More than 75% of ten-year-olds cannot read “for meaning”, according to a standard international test. In almost half of all primary schools, not a single pupil can do so. </p><p>Qunu’s primary school is where a teacher bestowed the name of “Nelson” on a pupil, Rolihlahla Mandela. Yet the school’s “Mandela library” is closed because the building collapsed. The average class size is more than 60. Teachers note that last year Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, opened a state-funded Mandela museum up the road. Meanwhile their school does not have running water and children go hungry because the provincial government has stopped paying for meals. “People think because this is Mandela’s town we get special treatment, but we don’t,” says one resident.</p><p>Based on how turnout has declined among under-30s in recent elections, perhaps just one in four “born-frees” will vote in May. Under-35s are more likely to consider ditching unelected governments for hypothetical autocrats who can deliver jobs. “You only vote if you believe in something,” says Mbongeni Mkwanazi. “This democracy thing is not working,” adds Funeka Shuping. “It can feel like the system is designed to suppress the black man.” What about the rights in the constitution? “Rights? I have a right to shelter in the constitution,” he says, “but I’m stuck in my grandmother’s house.” </p><p>The next stop is Johannesburg, South Africa’s commercial capital, where Mandela fled after his rural guardian tried to force him into an arranged marriage. In Soweto, the township where Mandela lived, it is clear that the black middle class has expanded since 1994. Last year saw the opening of Soweto’s first “lifestyle estate”, the sort of development associated with rich whites. There are private clinics and private schools serving the local market. </p><figure><iframe/></figure><p>A rigorous study of class published in 2019, by Rocco Zizzamia of Oxford University and colleagues, used national income data to divvy up South Africans into five categories based on whether they were chronically poor, transiently poor (ie, moving in and out of poverty), vulnerable (just above the poverty line), middle-class or elite. Blacks, who are 81% of the population, make up a disproportionate share of the first three categories. Nevertheless blacks today make up about two-thirds of the middle class and more than a fifth of the elite. Whites, some 7% of the population, make up more than a fifth of the middle class and about two-thirds of the elite. </p><h2>Socialites or socialists?</h2><p>The growth of a black bourgeoisie has led to a partial integration across apartheid’s barriers. The share of black people saying they socialise with other races rose five-fold from 2003 (6%) to 2023 (30%), according to <small>SARBS</small>. Those saying that they regularly interact with people of other races rose from 15% to 37%. Other polls suggest that most South Africans do not report experiencing racism in everyday life. </p><p>Sandre Esemang, a financial adviser whose Mini weaves in and out of Soweto’s potholes, says it was hard to be a black woman in a white-dominated firm in the 1990s. But for her daughter, a recent graduate, “things are much easier”. Ziyanda Ntombela says that her parents scrimped to send her to a mostly white school in the 1990s but were reluctant to have her friends over. (“They were like, ‘Who the fuck is Felicity? We wanted you to learn with white kids, not be friends with them’.”) With her own daughters diverse sleepovers are the norm. </p><figure><img src="static_images/7b75bb9d4b43afb2c5608b439533604b.png" alt="None" class="te_img"/></figure><p>But the water-cooler and pyjama parties can do only so much. Most blacks remain poor. And what narrowing there has been in the ratio of average white to black incomes since the 1990s has been largely because of gains among black earners in the top 10% of the distribution, according to a paper co-authored by Amory Ghetin of the Paris School of Economics. Among blacks, “poverty and inequality” are cited as the main hindrance to reconciliation. “The rich among us get richer while the poor stay poor,” says Vusi Mlambo, a plumber. “We are politically free but not economically free,” argues Khensani Nkonde, who runs a charity.</p><p>Joleen Kotze, the chief researcher at<small> SASAS</small>, argues that South Africans’ attitudes to democracy and race relations are strongly associated with their opinions about their own welfare and government performance. That helps explain the paradox of more integration among those with a bit of money, while views on whether race relations have improved since 1994 have soured overall. </p><h2>Running twice as hard</h2><p>It does not help that middle-class black South Africans often think that whites struggle to empathise with their difficulties. “There is a difference between first-generation wealth and 20th-generation wealth,” says Andrew Mgaga, a self-employed Sowetan. Ms Esemang raises the role of the “black tax”, the custom of sharing pay with relatives. “We are always playing catch-up as black people.” </p><p>Notably whites now say that racism—not poverty and inequality—is the biggest barrier to reconciliation. And they do not mean their own. Ms Kotze says their views reflect a common opinion that policies around affirmative action (“Employment Equity”) and the redistribution of wealth (“Black Economic Empowerment”) are unfair in favouring non-white groups. She argues that “the greatest irony is that white South Africans and black South Africans are having the same conversation from different perspectives—and that’s a conversation about economic exclusion”. </p><p>If there were more jobs to go around, there would be less tension across class and racial divides. But in a low-growth, low-trust country, politics can quickly become zero-sum. And that makes reconciliation difficult.</p><figure><img src="static_images/b459f859ecd64ed6e6c7f0be670473bd.jpg" alt="A boy takes his dog for a walk in Soweto, South Africa" class="te_img"/><figcaption> Born free</figcaption></figure><p>Zero-sum politics also creates opportunities for populists to weaponise poverty and identity. Return to Inanda, in KwaZulu-Natal (<small>KZN</small>), a province dominated by Zulus, the country’s largest ethnic group. Jacob Zuma, South Africa’s former president—and very much a Zulu—founded uMkhonto we Sizwe (<small>MK</small>) last September. The new party may well win the most votes in <small>KZN</small> and finish fourth nationally, according to recent polls. </p><p><small>MK</small> mixes anti-white populism with Zulu tribalism. Like the Economic Freedom Fighters (<small>EFF</small>), South Africa’s third-largest party, it blames whites and their supposed black collaborators, like Mr Ramaphosa, for South Africa’s ills. <small>MK</small> says South Africa is “dominated culturally, artistically, spiritually and economically by a minority group with an alien culture”. Both parties want to expropriate land without compensation. <small>MK</small> even suggests it wants to ditch the liberal constitution.</p><p>Mr Zuma is also adept at whipping up Zulu chauvinism. On the campaign trail for <small>MK</small> he has suggested that if the country were governed by “African law”, then gay marriage would be banned. In an unsubtle dog whistle, he has questioned why there would be speakers of Tswana (another official language) in <small>KZN</small>. </p><p>“How come Mandela voted here and they don’t take care of this thing?” says Nathi Khuzwayo, who wakes at 4am to pump the toilets in his restaurant, because the sewage system has failed. A judge-led inquiry concluded in 2022 that Mr Zuma was central to “state capture” that saw the looting of publicly owned enterprises. But that is of little importance to Mr Khuzwayo and other <small>MK</small> supporters. <small>MK</small>, in his view, would do a better job because it is a party of Zulus for Zulus. He compares it to how the Democratic Alliance (<small>DA</small>), the country’s second-largest party, looks after its own tribe, which in his view are South Africa’s whites. “Let it be tribal,” he says. “It’s a different game now.”</p><p>Yet <small>MK</small> is playing with fire. Pluralities of South Africans say that their strongest group association is with those who speak the same language. It should be a warning that vigilantes have attacked black foreigners, often Zimbabweans, in townships in increasing numbers in the past 15 years. </p><p>South Africa’s democracy has some inherent resilience to ugly populism. The compromises of 1994 helped normalise democratic rule, peaceful transfers of power and consensus-building across racial and tribal divisions. The way the apartheid regime tried to undermine a common black—and non-racial South African—identity has not been forgotten. Most South Africans have dual identities, as South Africans and as Zulus, Xhosas, Vendas, Afrikaners, and so on. </p><p>There is still something of a centre-ground in South African politics. Polls suggest that a plurality of South African voters—as well as a plurality of <small>ANC</small> voters—would want the <small>DA</small> as the <small>ANC</small>’s coalition partner. There is desperation for better leadership and “a charismatic autocrat would do well here, but so too would a charismatic and compelling liberal democrat,” argues Frans Cronje, a political analyst. He likens South Africa’s democracy to an immune system that should repel harmful elements. </p><h2>The danger if hope dies</h2><p>The danger is if—to extend the metaphor—the body politic becomes so weak that it loses its powers of defence. The larger the chasm between the expectations raised by 1994 and the reality of 2024, the larger the opportunity for those who do not believe in a non-racial, liberal society to fill the gap. Despondency about democracy could metastasise into something much more ugly.</p><figure><iframe/></figure><p>Near the museum in Inanda is Sandile Maphumulo, a 32-year-old who was born in Inanda but studies in Germany (see video above). He is back for the elections. Near the spot where Mandela voted he looks down towards the ocean, contrasting his township with the villas by the beach. </p><p>Though he values greater social cohesion, “the real struggle is not for black people to be friends with white people,” says Mr Maphumulo. “The real struggle is for black people to have a better life.” <span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Sign up to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/middle-east-dispatch">Middle East Dispatch</a>, a weekly newsletter that keeps you in the loop on a fascinating, complex and consequential part of the world.</i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/05/02/how-south-africa-has-changed-30-years-after-apartheid" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/05/02/how-south-africa-has-changed-30-years-after-apartheid</a> </p>
