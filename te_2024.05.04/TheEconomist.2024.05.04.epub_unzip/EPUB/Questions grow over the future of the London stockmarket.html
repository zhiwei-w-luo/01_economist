Others are mulling their options</h3><h3 class="te_article_datePublished">May 02th 2024</h3><br/><div class="head_image_div"><img src="static_images/4f4f122e30a1105b4555b23ff6ff0b99.jpg" alt="" class="te_head_image"/></div><p><span>The London Stock Exchange </span>(<small>LSE</small>) is shrinking. The decline of one of the world’s oldest stockmarkets has been under way for a while, but recently the pace of exits has been accelerating. More than 20 listed companies are facing acquisition bids; firms with a market cap of around £100bn ($125bn) could delist from the <small>LSE</small> as a result of pending and proposed deals. </p><p>If this downward trend were to continue, small-cap firms—those which are valued between $300m and $2bn—could be gone from the exchange by 2028, according to Peel Hunt, an investment bank. Larger firms are also causing alarm. Twelve companies being targeted by would-be acquirers are in the<small> FTSE</small> 350, the 350 largest companies on the exchange, compared with just two last year.</p><p>Some of the exodus is being driven by private equity. The latest takeover is by Thoma Bravo, an American private-equity firm, which on April 26th agreed on a £4.3bn deal for Darktrace, a cyber-security firm. Other listed companies are being hunted by rivals. Anglo American, a London-listed miner, is the subject of a £31bn hostile takeover bid from <small>BHP</small>, an Australian mining company; that would deal a blow to London’s reputation as a centre for natural-resources companies. <small>BHP</small> has until May 22nd to lodge a formal bid. </p><p>Some firms are simply asking whether it makes sense to move to a different venue that can offer <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/14/the-mystery-of-britains-dirt-cheap-stockmarket">higher valuations</a>, a deeper pool of investors and proximity to important markets. Shell, an oil giant, says it has considered leaving. Unilever is likely to list its ice-cream business in Amsterdam. In February Tui, Europe’s largest travel company, abandoned the<small> LSE</small> in favour of a sole listing in Frankfurt. Investors, too, are keen to trade London’s miners, tobacco firms and stodgy old-economy businesses for more exciting tech stocks elsewhere. Changes in accounting standards and regulation have helped drive domestic pension funds and insurers into lower-risk assets such as bonds and out of British equity markets: they own 4% of shares in London-listed firms, down from 52% in 1993. </p><p>As listed firms leave, the pipeline of new joiners to take their place looks thin. Arm, a British chipmaker, and <small>CVC</small>, a private-equity firm that owns a stake in the Six Nations rugby competition, are among the firms to have chosen to float their shares elsewhere. Last year 23 companies floated their shares on London’s stockmarket, down from a peak of 136 in 2014.</p><p>Stock exchanges everywhere are becoming smaller. So far this year global public equity markets have shrunk by a net $120bn because of delistings, three times the amount taken out in all of 2023. Alternative sources of capital, such as private equity or venture capital, mean that firms are staying private for longer or opting out of public markets altogether. America’s stockmarket has almost half the number of companies it did three decades ago. Germany has shed more than two-fifths of its public companies since 2007. </p><figure><img src="static_images/306fb9aac9023531b2c00497e9c68c77.png" alt="None" class="te_img"/></figure><p>But Britain’s decline is more entrenched (see chart) and is notable, too, for the plummeting value of its stocks. The total market capitalisation of London-listed firms has fallen from $4.3trn in 2007 to around $3trn this year. In contrast, the value of American stocks has trebled to more than $50trn over the same period.</p><p>London still has its attractions. Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s chancellor, is courting Shein, an online fast-fashion group headquartered in Singapore, which is considering a listing in London. Mytilineos, a Greek energy firm, is thinking of moving its listing from Athens to the City. Not being American can work: several Chinese companies have chosen the Swiss stockmarket to raise capital in response to political tension between the governments in Beijing and Washington, <small>DC</small>. </p><p>But reversing the exchange’s long-term decline will be difficult. The options to merge with a rival exchange have narrowed sharply. Brexit has not helped London’s attractiveness as a financial centre. The government has proposed measures to boost the flow of funds, including refining stamp-duty rules on share purchases, consolidating pension funds and introducing an extra tax-free <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/03/14/the-government-wants-investors-to-buy-british">annual allowance to invest in local firms</a>. Some of these reforms are sensible, some come close to protectionism. None is likely to hold back the tide. <span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/blighty">sign up</a> to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter. </i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/05/02/questions-grow-over-the-future-of-the-london-stockmarket" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/05/02/questions-grow-over-the-future-of-the-london-stockmarket</a> </p>
