That is the perception many people have of the craft of quiltmaking—not without reason. In “The Little House on the Prairie”, an iconic book series depicting the life of settlers in the Midwest in the 1870s, Laura and Mary learn patchworking skills as children. American quilts from the 19th and 20th centuries often have a patriotic flair, some even adorned with portraits of presidents. Scores of handmade quilts are catalogued in the Library of Congress.</p><p>A grand part of the tradition of quilting in America are its annual quilt shows. These evolved from county fairs but are now huge stand-alone events. Alongside the meticulously stitched quilts, submitted for prizes, are everything hobbyists might need for their efforts. That includes not just thread and yards of colourful fabric, bundled up into “jelly rolls”, “fat quarters” and “layer cakes” (all of which can help a quilter produce distinctive works), but also $12,000 movable long-arm quilting machines, the size of dining tables, which enable the user to quilt designs as easily as they might paint a canvas. </p><p>One of the biggest—the “mecca” of quilt shows, according to one attendee—is the show hosted in late April in Paducah, Kentucky, nestled on the southern bank of the Ohio river. Nicknamed “Quilt City”, Paducah boasts the world’s largest quilting museum. Some 30,000 people attend the annual show, roughly doubling the city’s population.</p><p>Any idea that America’s grandest quilt show might be an all-American affair, however, is quickly dispelled once inside it. For hanging among the many American entries were submissions from Australia, South Korea and dozens from Japan. Of the 31 prizes awarded to quilts in Paducah, 11 went to Japanese entries. (One winner was Australian, the rest were American.)</p><p>Quilts submitted to shows are divided into all kinds of categories. There are different ones for different sizes (from miniature to large); for the type of workmanship carried out on each quilt (from hand-sewn to “stationary” machined and movable long-arm machined); and yet more for the style of the design, such as “modern” or “pictorial”. </p><p>The Japanese entries tend to dominate the handwork categories. First, second and third in the hand-quilting category, plus the honourable mention, all went to Japanese submissions, as did the overall prize for best hand-workmanship. Japan has a long tradition of hand-embroidering clothing with patches and decorative stitching, often to reinforce or mend a garment, a practice known as <i>sashiko</i>. </p><p>The three-layer quilts that are entered in modern quilt shows (made up of a decorative top layer, a fluffy wadding layer and a backing material) are a more recent Japanese pastime. They were introduced to Japan after the second world war by women returning from America. They gained popularity when the television adaptation of “Little House on the Prairie<i>” </i>was broadcast in Japan in the 1970s. Japanese quiltmakers began to win acclaim for their quilts in the 1980s and 1990s. Japan now hosts several quilt shows of its own. </p><p>For world-class quilters, however, the most competitive shows remain the American ones. Although foreign quilt shows do award cash prizes, these pale in comparison with the sums won at American ones. The top prize, for the best-in-show quilt in Paducah, which is awarded if the maker agrees to surrender their quilt to the Paducah museum for its collection, is $20,000.<span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/us-in-brief">The <small>US </small>in brief</a>, our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a>, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/05/02/a-surprising-japanese-presence-in-a-traditional-american-craft" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/05/02/a-surprising-japanese-presence-in-a-traditional-american-craft</a> </p>
