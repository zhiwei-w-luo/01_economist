Hawaiians and surfers use the hand signal (made by folding three fingers down while extending the thumb and little finger, and sometimes twisting the wrist) in many ways: to say aloha, for instance, or let someone pass while driving. “I would describe it as a symbol of happiness,” said Glenn Wakai, the state senator who introduced the bill. It sailed through the legislative process. If the governor signs it into law, it will be America’s first official state gesture.</p><p>It would join a rich and varied list of symbols across the country—more than 1,670 in all, a cornucopia of flora, fauna and cultural exotica. Maine has a state treat, the whoopie pie. South Carolina has a style of dance, the shag. State reptiles abound, from the horned toad (Wyoming) to the collared lizard (Oklahoma). New Mexico even has an official state aroma, the smell of “green chile roasting in the fall”. </p><p>State symbols have a long history. Ryan Prager, who manages the website State Symbols <small>USA</small>, traces it back to the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago when each state was represented by a flower in a garland. The practice blossomed. Symbols can project a state’s identity and protect its cultural heritage. Mr Wakai said he wanted to make sure Hawaii got the shaka first: he is still miffed that California (like Hawaii) made surfing a state sport. “Hawaii is the birthplace of surfing. How in the world did California claim it?”</p><p>In 2022 Washington state nabbed the fast-growing pastime of pickleball as a state sport (pointing to its origins in Bainbridge Island in 1965). But not all symbols pander to popularity. Two states, New Hampshire and South Carolina, have official spiders. And for well over a decade Jo Handelsman, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has been championing a state microbe. </p><p>Among other things, <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> is used to make cheese, a big local industry. Professor Handelsman said the idea to make it a state symbol started off as a joke in a meeting of the bacteriology department. Colleagues were considering how to educate people about the benefits of microbes, but then they decided: “That’s actually a great idea.” The first attempt to pass it, in 2009, failed, but it is back on the agenda.</p><p>For politicians, state symbols can seem an easy win, as the ideas often draw bipartisan support and don’t necessarily cost anything. But they are not without risk. Lawmakers can face ridicule if they are seen to focus on symbols at the expense of substance. Legislative history is littered with failed proposals for symbols—from the slinky to saltwater taffy and waltzes.<span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/us-in-brief">The <small>US </small>in brief</a>, our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a>, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/04/30/hawaii-may-soon-have-americas-first-official-state-gesture" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/04/30/hawaii-may-soon-have-americas-first-official-state-gesture</a> </p>
