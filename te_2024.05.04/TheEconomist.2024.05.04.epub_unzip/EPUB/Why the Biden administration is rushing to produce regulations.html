Consider the three days between April 23rd and April 25th. The Federal Trade Commission (<small>FTC</small>) issued a sweeping rule banning non-compete clauses in the contracts of almost all American employees. The Department of Labour is expanding the set of workers who must receive mandatory overtime pay (to those who make less than $58,656 a year). The Environmental Protection Agency issued strict guidelines on coal-fired power stations that will probably spell their demise by 2039. </p><p>More regulations, big and small, are expected soon. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is planning to rewrite the rules governing interstate electricity transmission, which is critical to President Joe Biden’s decarbonisation plans. A different agency, the Department of Energy, is debuting new efficiency standards for dishwashers and water heaters. The Department of Justice is expected soon to propose classifying marijuana, which at the moment is lumped in the same class of substances as heroin and <small>LSD</small>, as a less dangerous drug.</p><p>Why the sudden spate? A previously obscure law, the Congressional Review Act (<small>CRA</small>) of 1996, helps explain the rush. It allows Congress, for a limited period, to pass resolutions of disapproval against finalised administrative regulations with which it disagrees. If both chambers of Congress pass such a resolution, and the president signs it, the rule is cancelled, short-circuiting the usual drawn-out process of litigation or a subsequent administration beginning a whole new rule-making effort. So once a regulation is properly created the clock starts ticking: the cancellation procedure is allowed for up to 60 days that the Senate is in session—including the last 60 days of an administration that loses a presidential election. </p><p>The <small>CRA</small> means that rules the Biden administration attempts to rush through in its waning days could be torn out before the glue has time to dry. Donald Trump is the undisputed champion of such manoeuvres. When he took office in 2017, Republicans, blessed with unified control of government, used the <small>CRA</small> to cancel 16 rules that Barack Obama’s administration had put in place. Before that, the law had been successfully used only once, in November 2001, to cancel a rule setting out ergonomics guidelines for businesses.</p><p>Since then it has become a worry for policymakers—and a strategy for opponents of regulations. Mr Biden himself used it three times to cancel Mr Trump’s administrative actions. Bank lobbyists are praying that stringent new rules that the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are working on, like the so-called Basel III endgame which would raise capital requirements by an estimated 21% for the biggest banks, are issued late enough that a future Republican Congress can cancel them. </p><p>“Any time there’s a presidential transition potentially looming, the pace of regulatory activity picks up,” says Steven Balla, a professor at George Washington University who helps run its Regulatory Studies Centre. The threat of the <small>cra</small> means that rather than having until Inauguration Day in January, bureaucrats need to finish their work sooner, probably by July at the latest, in order for their rules to be <small>cra</small>-proof. </p><p>As delightful as these arcana of administrative law are in their own right, they will also determine whether much of Mr Biden’s policy agenda succeeds or fails. With his pro-union legislation thwarted in Congress and unlikely to pass through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, the president’s pro-labour economic agenda is now being advanced by agencies like the <small>FTC</small>. That agency is also pondering a rule that would attempt to ban “<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/05/02/joe-biden-is-practising-some-clintonian-politics">junk fees</a>”, the nuisance surcharges that American consumers must deal with. On its traditional remit, antitrust enforcement, the <small>FTC</small> issued new merger-review guidelines in December 2023 that promise to scrutinise deals for monopolistic power over workers and suppliers instead of just consumers.</p><h2><b>Climate climax</b></h2><p>The ticking clock is especially important for climate policy. The Inflation Reduction Act, a misnamed climate bill, is expected by independent modellers to double the rate of carbon-emissions decline, from 2% a year to 4%. Its success depends on reams of rules that will need to be consistently enforced if businesses are to be convinced to plan around clean-energy subsidies. </p><p>Decarbonisation will also depend on other rules that Mr Biden’s environmental brain trust has spent years crafting: restricting the amount of mercury that coal-fired power stations can belch into the air, or the carbon emissions that new gas-fired power stations may produce. The Bureau of Land Management, which administers the vast amount of land owned by the federal government and the energy-exploration projects allowed on them, has prioritised conservation of public lands and fast permitting of geothermal-energy projects. The White House Council on Environmental Quality has finalised a rule that is intended to expedite the permitting and environmental-review processes required for new infrastructure projects—the technocratic snags that could thwart Mr Biden’s entire environmental plan.</p><p>All of this could of course still be overturned by the usual, slower measures of litigation or an incoming Trump administration embarking on deregulation. But it is no wonder that the Biden bureaucrats are bustling about. The Federal Register, the grand repository of all rules, may reach 100,000 pages this year—the largest number ever recorded. <span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/us-in-brief">The <small>US </small>in brief</a>, our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a>, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/05/02/why-the-biden-administration-is-rushing-to-produce-regulations" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/05/02/why-the-biden-administration-is-rushing-to-produce-regulations</a> </p>
