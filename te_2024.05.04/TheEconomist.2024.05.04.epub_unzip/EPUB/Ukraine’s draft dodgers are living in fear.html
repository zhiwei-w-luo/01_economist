Russian <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/28/russia-is-losing-the-battle-for-the-black-sea">warships</a> dominated Odessa’s horizon and the streets were barricaded with tank traps. Normal people were preserving whatever they had. But for a group of former philosophy students, it was the moment dreams were made and they poured everything into the project. By early summer 2022 they had refashioned a beauty salon into a new cultural hotspot, selling erotic photography and moonshine vodka. They mused about becoming partisans to fight the Russians should they ever appear. </p><p>No one remembers exactly when the party stopped. It was a shock when the first young man from the group left the country. But then a second departed. Customers began vanishing, as the fear of being sent to the front lines grew. In late 2023 the bar’s owner escaped across the border with a medical exemption certificate that said he had diabetes. Ultimately only “Sasha”, the barman, remained.</p><aside><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis"><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war</i></a></p></aside><p>Vladyslav, who is 24, also began the war as a committed patriot. In the early months, he watched the reports of Russian atrocities, and felt a strong urge to fight. Then the males in his life started to leave— they went east, to the front line. Friends, relatives, his father and step-father all became soldiers. And Vladyslav started receiving chilling updates about the reality of war with too little ammunition. Many of his friends died. A colleague was killed just three days after being sent to Bakhmut. Another was assumed dead after being captured in Mariupol, only to be later returned in a prisoner exchange, saying he had been tortured. Vladyslav’s family now urge him to stay clear of the conscription officers who prowl Odessa’s streets. He is heeding their advice and hiding. “It’s not that I’m scared to fight, but I’m scared because I know what’s happening out there.” </p><p>For a generation of young men in <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/27/why-is-odessa-important-to-both-ukraine-and-russia">Odessa</a>, life has been postponed indefinitely. Choices are not black and white. Of those not already fighting, more and more are hiding from Odessa’s conscription officers, who have a reputation for ruthlessness. Men in green uniforms conduct regular sweeps of the city’s buses, gyms and train stations, often dragging their targets off by force. That has tested allegiances in a city that has always worn its Ukrainian identity lightly. </p><p>The recent lowering of the minimum mobilisation age from 27 to 25 (soon to include Vladyslav) is a further challenge. Parliament took months to pass the new law, which comes into effect on May 1st. It was an urgent necessity for the military, which is struggling to hold the front lines. Perhaps its most significant provision is a requirement that all draft-eligible men register in a new online database, increasing their vulnerability to draft officers.</p><p>For men like Sasha, the barman, that presents an impossible dilemma. He feels stuck in the middle, he says, not wanting to leave his home but fearful the draft officers might knock on his door next. “You can leave, but it’s a one-way ticket. You can go to the front lines, but that may be a one-way ticket too. Or you can stay here and live in fear.” One estimate late last year suggested 650,000 men of fighting age had left Ukraine, the majority by illegal means. Getting papers to leave was once a matter of paying a few thousand dollars to a corrupt officer. Now it is nearly impossible. The need on the front lines is stronger than ever, and no one is volunteering to fight.</p><p>Vladyslav has witnessed several raids. He describes the draft officers as “fishermen” who “catch” their victims, to use the local lingo. “The officers lurk near bus stops and stop the buses as they depart, checking the documents of any guy that matches their profile.” Odessa is being singled out by leaders in Kyiv, he says. There, recruitment plans are far less aggressive. “Everyone says victory is near, but it feels quite far away if you are a 25-year-old in Odessa.” Only the bravest young men ride public transport. </p><p>The conscription officers are reluctant to talk. <i>The Economist</i> sent two requests for comment, only to be told to send a third. Two army officers requested anonymity just to say they were uncomfortable discussing the subject. Ruslan Horbenko, an <small>MP </small>who is deputy head of the parliamentary human rights committee, says draft officers have an unenviable task. Most of the forcible detentions they make concern not draft dodgers, he says, but deserters. In some brigades as many as 10% of the soldiers are believed to have fled. Along with western regions, Odessa is one of their prime destinations, he says. Soldiers who have stayed on the front lines feel “abandoned” by those who flee, and recruitment officers take it out on the deserters they catch.</p><p>Those who are still in Odessa are mostly hiding. A trip to the philosophers’ bar on a recent Thursday night found only one man present. Female patrons, seated between racy pictures of women aimed at a missing male audience, gossiped about mobilisation. The rumours were flying: draft officers purportedly got an 8,000 hryvnia ($202) bonus for each guy they “catch”; Volodymyr Zelensky was about to lower the draft age to 20. Russia was supposedly preparing a new operation to take Odessa. Each of the rumours had a source: an aunt, married to a security officer; a father who works in the general staff; a brother on the front lines. One woman, who was 23 but looked much older, said her boyfriend is also in hiding, and refuses to move about town except by taxi. A barwoman admitted business had gone downhill since the men started disappearing. The bar will soon close, she said. </p><p>Vladyslav faces financial struggles, too. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion he earned a reasonable living selling plumbing equipment. Since then he has been unemployed. Without military papers he cannot look for a job. His girlfriend of five years is expecting their first child. He dreams of a life as a new father in a peaceful Ukraine, but that is hard to imagine with Russian missiles raining in. For Sasha, the last of Odessa’s philosopher dreamers, hope dies last. “Every night we go to bed with hope,” he says. “Hope that we will wake up in the morning alive.”<span class="span_ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/cafe-europa">Café Europa</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p><p class="link_navbar">This article was downloaded by <a href="https://z-lib.io" class="producer_link">zlibrary</a> from <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/04/28/dodging-the-draft-in-fearful-ukraine" class="origin_link">https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/04/28/dodging-the-draft-in-fearful-ukraine</a> </p>
